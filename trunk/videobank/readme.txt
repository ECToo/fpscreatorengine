V1.1.8
------
 
 * [SVN on GOOGLECODE now holds notes on additions, saves duplicating work!]

 * Fixed AIUSEMELEE=1 blood spurts
 * Added new FPI action AIROTATEY=X this will rotate the character to the angle specified by x
 * Added new FPI action AILOOKAROUND=X,Y this will rotate the character randomly between angle x and angle y
 * Added cool new adaptive bloom shader written by Mark Blosser (the legend)
 * Added new gunspec command BULLETLIMBTOTAL=X X is the amount of bullet limbs the weapon has 
 * Added new gunspec command BULLETHIDERESET=X X is the animation frame at which the bullets will all be scaled back to 100%
 * Added new gunspec command BULLETHIDESTART=X X is the amount of ammo for the system to begin to hide the visible bullets
 * Added new gunspec command BULLETHIDEMOD=X if x=1 then the weapon will use the bullet hide system
    NOTE!: Weapon MUST have the bullets limb's named correctly "BULLET" prefix and then which number bullet it is (limbs will be hidden from max limbs to 0).
     EXAMPLE!: BULLET0,BULLET1,BULLET2,BULLET3,BULLET4, ETC.... 
 * Added new BULLET HIDE feture (all bullet hide gunspec commands are a must for the system to work)
 * Added new FPI action called EXPLODE this will cause an explodable entity to trigger its explosion OR if the object is a scriptable flak object then the flak will explode
    NOTE: If it is a scriptable flak object, upon explosion the entity/flak will not die allowing flak to have multiple explosions, for flak destory must be called to destroy the flak object
 * Added new gunspec switchtoalt=x,y by default to switch to an alternate weapon you have to press the number key of the weapon you are currently on.
    this command allows you to change that (THE Y PERAMATER IS OPTIONAL). 
    For example switchtoalt=33 will allow you to use the 'F' key to switch to your weapons alternate mode. 
    The Y peramater allows you to do key combos, for example switchtoalt=33,56 will allow it so you use 'ALT' + 'F' to swap to your weapons alternate mode.  
 * Added new FPI condition called UNDERWATER=X this will return true if the entity is under the water surface
 * Added new FPI condition called PLRUNDERWATER=X this will return true if the player is under the water surface
 * Added new FPI condition called PLRNOTFACING which is true when the player is not facing the entity scripted
 * Added water "effects" such as water physics, swimming, water ripple, water splashes...etc
 * Added WATERFOGDIST=X to change how far away the underwater fog is
 * Added WATERFOGBLUE=X to change the blue value of the water's underwater color
 * Added WATERFOGGREEN=X to change the green value of the water's underwater color
 * Added WATERFOGRED=X to change the red value of the water's underwater color
 * Added WATERBLUE=X to change the blue value of the water's color
 * Added WATERGREEN=X to change the green value of the water's color
 * Added WATERRED=X to change the red value of the water's color
 * Added WATERSPEED=X to change the water ripple speed
 * Added WATERHEIGHT=X to specify the water's Y position
 * Added WATER=X to toggle water on and off
 * Added Water
 * Added NEXTLEVEL=X this will specify which level to jump to (this command will not end the current level, it will simply jump to the level specified after the current level has ended via winzone, etc.)
 * Added DIMLOCALVAR=X Works just like DIMVAR=X only makes the variable local to the entity (just like localvar=x only allows 	you to use the new variable system)
 * Added PASSTOSETUP=X Y x is equal to the string you would like to insert/change in the setup .ini Y is the value to give it
	Example: passtosetup=dynamicshadows 1
 * Removed SAVESETUP to save the changes to the setup.ini (MUST CALL BEFORE RESET)
 * Removed SETUP_DYNAMICSHADOWS=X to change the setup.ini's dynamicshadows setting
 * Removed SETUP_USEEFFECTS=X to change the setup.ini's useeffects setting
 * Removed SETUP_DIVIDETEXTURESIZE=X to change the setup.ini's dividetexturesize setting
 * Removed SETUP_MOUSESENSITIVITY=X to change the setup.ini's mousesensitivity setting 
 * Removed SETUP_ASPECTRATIO=X to change the setup.ini's aspectratio setting
 * Removed SETUP_POSTPROCESSING=X to change the setup.ini's postprocessing setting
 * Removed SETUP_WIDTH=X to change the setup.ini's width setting
 * Removed SETUP_HEIGHT=X to change the setup.ini's height setting
 * Removed SETUP_DEPTH=X  to change the setup.ini's depth setting
 * Updated arena player name entry and arena IP address entry to allow the backspace key to remove characters.
 * Updated arena chat messages so the backspace key removes string characters from messages.
 * Fixed 'super jump' bug that can occur in arena games.
 * NOTE: V117 and above on Vista require SP1 or above to function properly
 * Added SAVESETUP to save the changes to the setup.ini (MUST CALL BEFORE RESET)
 * Added RESET to reset the engine so the new setup.ini changes will be applied
 * Added SETUP_DYNAMICSHADOWS=X to change the setup.ini's dynamicshadows setting
 * Added SETUP_USEEFFECTS=X to change the setup.ini's useeffects setting
 * Added SETUP_DIVIDETEXTURESIZE=X to change the setup.ini's dividetexturesize setting

 * Halved the power of the Bloom in response to community feedback
 * Added Project Blue's variable system
 * REWROTE the way Airmod's alternate fire works. All it was doing was making a mess of the engine and didn't even have support for all primary gunspec commands
    Now you can use any gunspec command (excluding melee key=x, weaponisammo=x,altto=x,y, altfrom=x,y, addtospare=x,sound#=x, altsound=x, soundframes=x, and sframe=x)
     with the alternate fire feature.
     Simply use the word "alt" before the gunspec command you wish to use. For example to declare simple zoom in alternate mode I would use:

 * Added new FPI condition AIHASTARGET=X this will return ture if the entity has a target
 * Added new FPI action AIATTACKAWARNESS=X by default this is turned on which causes the AI to go into "attack mode" when the see an enemy. Turning this off can make your AI ignore an enemy or aid in having the break away from a battle. 
 * Added new FPI condition AICALLEDBYPLR=X this will return if the entity has been called by the AIPLRCALLTEAM=X command
 * Added new FPI action AIRESPONDTOPLRCALL=X this will cause a fellow player teammate to move towards the player (if any he for help)
 * Added new FPI action AISETSPEED=X this will change the ai character's current speed to the number specified by x
 * Added new FPI action AIPLRCALLTEAM=X this will alert teammates within x distance that the player needs help (to be used with other call commands)

 * Prevented .LOG files from being created with no meaningful filename associated with it
 * Improved ACTTALK action to allow $0 and $1 to work with externally called associated LIPSYNC file
 * Added code to prevent outright crash when meshes incorrectly specified (now default to mesh sphere)
 * Added new feature to AI obstacle code to detect Wall Large and Wall Small (creating full/half walls)
 * Added new FPI action AIMOVETOTARGET this will cause the entity to move to its target if it has one
 * Added new FPI action AISTOP this will stop the AI entity right away
 * Added new FPI condition AIATCOVER=x this will return true if the entity is at the cover that the entity was instructed to move to by AIMOVETOCOVER=X
 * Cleaned up some of the OBSTACLE container code and included new X10 modules (for later inclusion)
 * Added additional X10 inspired DarkAI code to include static entity obstacles

 * Added new FPI action AISETMELEEDAMAGE=X this will X is the amount of damage the entity will do with AIUSEMELEE=X
 * Added new FPI action AIUSEMELEE=X this will take away the amount of health specified by AISETMELEEDAMAGE=X from the entity's target. If X=1 then blood splats will be enabled for that hit
 * Added new FPI condition AITARGETDISTFURTHER=X this will check if the entities target is further then X distance (if the entity has no target this will return false)
 * Added new FPI condition AITARGETDISTWITHIN=X this will check if the entities target is within X distance (if the entity has no target this will return false)
 * Added new FPI action AIMOVETOCOVER=X if x is equal to 1 the entity will move to the closest unoccupied safe zone, if x is 0 the entity will move to cover based on its #1 targets X and z positions if the entity has no target it will move to a safe zone instead 
   Note: To make a safe zone name a trigger zone "safe zone" (without the quotes). Hopefully in the future we will be able to supply a zone in the Markers bank specially for safe zones for easier setup

 * Fixed crash caused by lifts (lift1.fpi on a trigger zone)
 * Added new FPI action ADDAITEAM=X x= the team number which can be anything you heart desiers. Team 1 is defaulted to the player
    This allows your enemies to have enemies who are all enemies of you. Meaning you can now have as many teams as you would like
     As a note team 1 is reserved for allies (so addaiteam=1 would add the character as the player's ally)
     for normal Allies versus enemies you can simply use addaiteam=1 for your allies and addaiteam=2 for enemies
      to add an extra team in there you could use addaiteam=3 (this team would be enemies of both team 2 and team 1) 
     Extra note the addaiteam command does not have to be in numerical order so if you wanted to add an enemy you could even do
     addaiteam=5000000000
